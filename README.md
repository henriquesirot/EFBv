# EFBv - Electronic Flight Bag

The EFBv is a realistic Electronic Flight Bag simulator, based on the Embraer model used in the E190/195 models. The software is aimed at aviation enthusiasts and virtual airline pilots, with toolsets to prepare and set up aircrafts, calculate performance, obtain weather and airport information and aeronautical charts from the official Brazilian bureau.

The entire software is purposed for educational use only. No other private or commercial use is permitted. The software code, however, is reserved by the developer, since no code from the original application has been used.
